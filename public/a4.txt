ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) with Functions
Definition:
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component of a computer's CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations.

Key Functions:

1.Arithmetic Operations:

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Increment/Decrement

2.Logical Operations:

AND, OR, NOT, XOR

Bitwise Shifts (Left Shift, Right Shift)

3.Comparison Operations:

Equal to, Greater than, Less than

Zero Detection

->Components of ALU:

Input Registers: Store operands for operations.

Output Register: Stores the result of operations.

Control Signals: Determine which operation to perform.

Flags: Indicate the status of operations (e.g., overflow, zero result).

Example (Simple ALU Operations):

def ALU(operation, a, b):
    if operation == "ADD":
        return a + b
    elif operation == "SUB":
        return a - b
    elif operation == "AND":
        return a & b
    elif operation == "OR":
        return a | b
    elif operation == "XOR":
        return a ^ b
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported operation")
Role in CPU:

The ALU works in conjunction with the Control Unit and registers to execute instructions.

It performs calculations and logical decisions required by programs.
