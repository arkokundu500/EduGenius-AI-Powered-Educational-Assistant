Virtual Memory
Definition:
Virtual Memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources" available on a machine. It allows a computer to use more memory than is physically available by temporarily transferring data to disk storage.

Key Concepts:

Paging: Divides memory into fixed-size blocks called pages.

Page Table: Maps virtual addresses to physical addresses.

Page Fault: Occurs when a program accesses a page not currently in RAM, triggering the OS to load it from disk.

Swap Space: Disk space used to store inactive pages.

Advantages:

Allows running large programs even with limited physical RAM.

Provides memory isolation and protection between processes.

Enables efficient use of memory by loading only required pages.

How It Works:

Programs use virtual addresses instead of physical addresses.

The OS and hardware translate virtual addresses to physical addresses using the page table.

If a page is not in RAM (page fault), it is loaded from disk.

Inactive pages are swapped out to disk to free up RAM.
