Title:  Implementing  Plant  Epidemiology  Concepts  Using  Image-Only  Rose  Leaf  Disease  
Dataset
 
By:  Supratim  Nag  
 
Objective  
To  investigate  and  simulate  plant  epidemiological  modeling  using  a  rose  leaf  disease  image  
dataset,
 
by
 
integrating
 
synthetic
 
metadata
 
and
 
statistical
 
analysis
 
into
 
a
 
deep
 
learning
 
classification
 
pipeline.
 
 
Current  System  Overview  
●  Dataset :  Contains  350  images  each  of  four  disease  categories:  Healthy,  BlackSpot,  
Yellow
 
Mosaic
 
Virus,
 
and
 
Insect
 
Hole.
 
 ●  Model :  Custom  CNN  trained  initially  on  binary  classification  (BlackSpot  vs  Healthy).  
 ●  Goal :  Expand  to  multiclass  classification  and  simulate  disease  spread,  risk  factors,  and  
severity
 
using
 
synthetic
 
metadata.
 
 
 
Concepts  of  Plant  Epidemiology  
Plant  epidemiology  involves  studying  how  plant  diseases  emerge,  spread,  and  can  be  predicted  
or
 
prevented.
 
Key
 
concepts
 
include:
 
●  Disease  Triangle :  Interaction  between  host,  pathogen,  and  environment.  
 ●  Disease  Incidence :  Percentage  of  infected  plants  at  a  given  time.  
 ●  Risk  Factor :  A  variable  (e.g.,  high  humidity)  associated  with  increased  disease  
probability.
 
 ●  Odds  Ratio :  A  statistical  measure  showing  association  between  risk  factor  and  disease.  
 ●  Epidemic  Curve :  Graph  showing  new  cases  over  time.  
 
 
Adapting  Epidemiology  to  Image-Only  Datasets  
Although  we  lack  actual  spatial-temporal  data,  synthetic  metadata  can  be  simulated  to  emulate  
field-like
 
epidemiological
 
scenarios.
 
Simulated  Fields:  
Parameter  Type  Description  
Date  Temporal  Simulated  capture  date  for  each  image  
Location  ID  Spatial  Simulated  field  grid  (e.g.,  Zone  A1,  A2...)  
Plant  ID  Categorical  Simulated  identifier  per  plant  
Weather  Tag  
Categorical  Assigned  by  class  correlation  (e.g.,  BlackSpot  =  humid)  
Label  Categorical  Disease  class  from  manual  or  model  label   
Implementation  Roadmap  
Phase  1:  Multiclass  Classification  
●  Extend  CNN  to  support  four-class  classification.  
 ●  Use  metrics  such  as  precision,  recall,  F1-score,  and  confusion  matrix.  
 
Phase  2:  Metadata  Simulation  
●  Generate  synthetic  metadata  (date,  location,  plant  ID)  for  each  image.  
 ●  Map  disease  classes  to  environmental  tags  (e.g.,  humidity  for  BlackSpot).  
 
Phase  3:  Epidemiological  Analysis  
●  Calculate  synthetic  disease  incidence  over  time.  
 ●  Visualize  trends  using  epidemic  curves.  
 ●  Estimate  odds  ratios  between  environmental  tags  and  disease  occurrence.  
 
Phase  4:  Severity  and  Progression  Modeling  
●  Use  CNN  confidence  scores  or  Grad-CAM  heatmaps  to  approximate  disease  severity.  
 ●  Simulate  repeated  image  capture  to  model  progression  over  time.  
 
Phase  5:  Dashboard  and  Visualization  
●  Build  a  Streamlit  dashboard  to:  
 ○  Upload  an  image  and  classify  disease  
 ○  Display  simulated  disease  incidence  and  severity  plots  
 ○  Provide  basic  outbreak  prediction  using  trend  extrapolation  
 
 
Conclusion  
Despite  limited  metadata,  plant  epidemiology  can  be  meaningfully  implemented  using  
image-only
 
datasets
 
through
 
simulation
 
and
 
logical
 
assumptions.
 
This
 
hybrid
 
approach
 
merges
 
AI
 
with
 
epidemiological
 
reasoning,
 
offering
 
a
 
valuable
 
framework
 
for
 
smart
 
agriculture
 
research.
